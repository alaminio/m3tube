YouTube implemented for me using ReactJs, React Router Dom, Redux, Redux-thunk and YouTube API v3 [https://m3tube.firebaseapp.com/](https://m3tube.firebaseapp.com/).

I use this script to listen music when I do not want other to know by looking at my computer screen which website I am browsing. This app has some known bug and most probably I will not fix it because it has everything I need and I do not perform action that will produce bug.

btw! I tried to use a lot of popular package like React Router Dom V4, Redux, Redux-thunk, MomentJS etc.

If you want to run this script, just run `npm install` and rename `/src/config/constants.sample.js` file to `/src/config/constants.js` and update google api key. API key has to be YouTube data api v3 enabled.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
